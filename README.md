# Fittr Flickr

*Note: given Flickr's redesigns this extension is mostly defunct. This is a migration from Google Code, which is shutting down.*

Chrome extension for enhancing the awesome photo sharing site, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com).

Visit the [Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fhaledancjhefginmkkondfjpnkhdglh) to install the latest stable release.

Or [click here](./fittr-flickr.crx) for the _beta_ installer, where updates and bug fixes will be tried out before they get pushed to the gallery.

*NOTE: If you installed the beta version from this site please make sure you have at least version 1.5.1, if you don't please reinstall from the above link.  I messed the auto-update while going back and forth between the chrome.google.com release and the beta.*
